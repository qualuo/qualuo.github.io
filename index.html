            <h4>Engineering</h4>
            <p> In high school, while studying sciences, I came to realize that I gained a lot of knowledge but was unable to do anything with it.
              Because of this, I chose to pursue engineering, where I now have the ability to put knowledge and also creativity to practical use. I enjoy solving problems and creating things.

                      <h5>Dunnig-Kruger Effect</h5> This effect is the bias in a person with low ability assessing themselves as superior. In the same vein as <i>"The more you know, the more you know you don't know," </i> said by Aristotle, and
                      Einstein's <i style="">“The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know.” </i> I understand that there is so much more than one can possibly know, and thus avoid overrating my abilities. A person can not accurately
                      evaluate oneself. Only when compared to others can that be done.

                      on the shoulders of giants.

                    <p>
                      <h5>Optimism</h5> I look at the bright things and try to avoid negativity. I believe in the greatness of humanity. Evident in our technological progress and ingenuity. Those who believe in the opposite would say that humanity is
                      a plague to the world.
                      I believe the opposite of that. I believe that whatever happens to the world, we will strive to look for sustainable methods and adjust to new conditions and move towards a brighter future. So that, ultimately, we may find the
                      answers
                      to our unanswered questions.
