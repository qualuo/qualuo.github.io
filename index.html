                    These algorithms are used in pathfinding, graph traversal. They are used in many applications, such as in games,

                    Using Python and a UI framework, I created "Pasteboard", a clipboard manager application that allows you to save and manage your clipboard history. 
                    An entry is made every time you use the Copy command and allows easy access to past entries.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The idea for this application appeared to me while trying out penetration testing that required variations of payloads. Managing snippets became a whole
                    lot easier with this tool, which can be used in many scenarios where you need to manage many versions of different snippets, or texts. Say trying
                    different approaches in an algorithm, or restructuring paragraphs of text.
                    Serving as a clipboard history, it also lets you save versions of texts and easily find them again later in a visual user interface.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Since then, Windows has implemented a lite feature with this functionality with Alt+V.

            <h4>Engineering</h4>
            <p> While studying the sciences, I came to realize that I gained a lot of knowledge but was unable to do anything with it.
              Because of this, I chose to pursue engineering, where one puts knowledge and also creativity to practical use. I enjoy solving problems and creating things.

                    <h5>Genshin Impact Lore</h5>
                    </p>
                      Genshin Impact is a live-service gacha RPG by miHoYo released in September 2020, and is among the world's most popular games. The game is among the most expensive games ever made, if not the most, at a cost of $500 million USD by its 2nd anniversary with a revenue of over $3 billion USD per year.
                      <br/><br/>  
                      I wrote and designed a series of lore articles for the game Genshin Impact, which became popular and viral within the community. The theories became a main influence in lore discussions and 
                      has significantly influenced the community's perception of the game's lore. Perhaps even the writers' as well.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <h5>Military Roleplay Leadership — Executive Officer & Gamemaster</h5>
                    <p>
                      Roleplay is used in real life to train all kinds of professions at their jobs. Be it paramedics, police, soldiers, or <a href="https://youtu.be/EQP-lfVRgX8?t=1950">government agents</a>. Roleplay simulates real scenarios while removing harmful and costly consequences.
                      <br/><br/>
                      For one year, I was part of a military roleplay community involving 100,000+ members — the largest of its kind. I rose through the ranks from private to executive officer of a reconnaissance division, 
                      co-commanding said division of around 100 active members. I gained recognition for my actions, leadership, and strategy, and was made an officer. 
                      As an officer I created comprehensive documentation of structure and procedures, and streamlined processes revolving recruitment, trainings, discipline and knowledge, improving overall management in an exemplary manner.
                      <br/><br/>
                      The chain of command (ascending order): Private, Private First Class, Lance Corporal, Corporal, Sergeant, Staff Sergeant, Sergeant First Class, Master Sergeant, First Sergeant, Sergeant Major, Warrant Officer, Second Lieutenant, First Lieutenant, Captain, Major, Lieutenant Colonel, Colonel, Executive Officer, Commander.
                      <br/><br/>
                      I was also accepted as a gamemaster for the community, orchestrating large-scale events and missions for the community with other gamemasters, as well as for smaller groups for more intimate storylines.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <h5>Typing, Guides & Articles</h5>
                    <p>
                      I've written multiple helpful guides and articles in different subjects to help others. In general, I just like to write, to share knowledge and help others out. 
                      My typing speed is 120+ words per minute (peak is higher) which is statistically in the top 1%, considered a "competitive speed".
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <h5>Translate Facebook — Translations used billions of times</h5>
                    <p>
                      I contributed to translating Facebook using its built-in web service, with contributions used many billions of times (according to Facebook's own system).
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <h5>Volunteering — Good will</h5>
                    <p>
                      I have spent a lot of time helping others with their problems related to technology/studies and sharing my knowledge, anonymously. Not for likes, reputation or money, but because I enjoy helping others and 
                      I believe it is the right thing to do. 
                    </p>

                    <h5>Occam's Razor</h5> 
                    <p>
                      I have a tendency to prefer simplicity. Designing for simplicity is best practice. It's a must to 
                      get more people to use your product. It's also a must to make it easier to maintain and extend.
                      Explaining things in a simple manner keeps things understandable and clear with less expended mental capacity. 
                      <br/><br/>
                      I like Einstein's quote: <i>"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."</i>
                      Often people make up explanations that kind of make sense, but don't really understand it themselves.
                      Being able to put things simply means you have a good understanding of the subject.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <h5>No self-rating</h5> 
                    <p>
                      The Dunning-Kruger effect is the bias in a person with low ability assessing themself as superior. In the same vein as <i>"The more you know, the more you know you don't know," </i> said by Aristotle, and
                      Einstein's quote: <i style="">“The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know.” </i> I understand that there is so much more than one can possibly know, and thus avoid overrating my abilities. A person can not accurately
                      evaluate oneself without comparing to something else for reference.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <h5>Ingenuity</h5> 
                    <p>
                      Effort is wasted when recreating something that already exists. That effort should instead be used to solve new problems, or at least make improved solutions to make progress. 
                      After all, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants">we stand on the shoulders of giants</a>. 
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <h5>Honesty</h5> 
                    <p>
                      I am a very honest person. I believe in a world without lies because it would be far more straight forward.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <h5>Positive Outlook</h5> 
                    <p>
                      I look at the bright things and try to avoid negativity. I believe in the greatness of humanity. Evident in our technological progress and ingenuity. 
                      Those who believe in the opposite would say that humanity is  plague to the world.
                      I believe the opposite of that. I believe that whatever happens to the world, we will strive to look for sustainable methods and adjust to new conditions, 
                      and move towards a brighter future, because that's the trend we have been on.
                      So that, ultimately, we may find the answers to our unanswered questions.
